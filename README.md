## Project Description
The landing page project is the second project in [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations) curriculum meant to help learners practice their flexbox skills.

You can view the project [here](https://annahcodes.github.io/odin-landing-page).

Besides practicing flexbox the project was also a chance to reinforce all the git skills learnt so far, especially the git workflow.
